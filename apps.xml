    QSGSimpleMaterialShader class to fill a shape in the scene

    boilerplate code required when creating materials with the \l
    QSGMaterial, \l QSGMaterialShader and \l QSGMaterialType classes
    directly.

    A simple material consists of two parts, the material state and
    the material shader. The material shader has one instance per
    scene graph and contains the actual OpenGL shader program and
    information about which attributes and uniforms it uses. The
    material state is what we assign to each individual node, in this
    case to give them different colors.</description><command>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib" XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/tmp" demos/qtdemos/simplematerial/simplematerial -platform wayland-egl &amp;</command><route>simplematerialwld</route></application><application name="Qt5 texture in sgnode On wayland"><description>Qt demo showing a qml element as texture, brief Shows how to use FramebufferObjects with Qt Quick.</description><command>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib" XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/tmp" demos/qtdemos/textureinsgnode/textureinsgnode -platform wayland-egl &amp;</command><route>textureinsgnodewld</route></application><application name="Disable Wayland"><description> It creates the symlinks in order to use fb libraries instead of wayland.
